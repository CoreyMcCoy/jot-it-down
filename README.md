### addItem() function

Adds an item (an object) to the list and updates the DOM and adds the item to localStorage.

### populateList() function

Populates the list with items from localStorage. I chose to use innerHTML to create the list items, inputs and button instead of creating new list elements and appending them and
so on.

### toggleList() function

Toggles a checkbox and updates the DOM and localStorage.

### removeItem() function

Removes an item from the list and updates the DOM and localStorage.
